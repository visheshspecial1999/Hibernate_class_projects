Note: We sue Cascade to make sure mapping data will get persist automatic inside Database.

1)class should be public non-abstract class
2)should have public default /zero parameterised constructor
3)All variables should be private 
4)All private variables should have public getter/setters
5)Declared a variable has primary key using @Id

META-INF folder

then under it persistence.xml -> File
